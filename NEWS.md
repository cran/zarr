# zarr 0.2.0

- Zarr version 2 stores can be read. Data types supported are those also included in the v.3 core specification. The `compression` codec has to be one of those supported by the v.3 core specification or `zstd`. Filters are not yet supported.
- HTTP stores can be read but only for Zarr v.3 and v.2 single-array stores and Zarr v.2 stores with consolidated metadata present in the root group of the Zarr store.
- Chunk key encoding from v.2 and "default" and "v2" from v.3 supported.
- The `blosc` package is now imported as it is the default compression codec.
- `zstd` compression codec added.
- Fixed reading `integer64` data.

# zarr 0.1.1

- Initial code base. This release contains a fairly complete implementation of the Zarr core v.3 specification. As such, it will not be able to access Zarr v.2 stores.
- Support for adding and deleting attributes to groups and arrays.
